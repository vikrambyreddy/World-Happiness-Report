# World-Happiness-Report

What makes people happy?

The World Happiness Report is a survey of the state of global happiness. The happiness scores (0-10) are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll.

Happiness Score Columns:

GDP per Capita Family Life Expectancy Freedom Generosity Trust Government Corruption Distopya Residual Metric (Dystopia Happiness Score (1.85) + Residual Value

If we add all these factors up, we will get the happiness score so it might be un-reliable to model them to predict Hapiness Scores.

Main goal is to do an descriptive analysis of the factors that make people happy
